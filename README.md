# Python Learning Journey

This repository is my logbook for learning Python.  
Each week I complete a small project to practice new concepts.

## Projects

- **Week 1** – Mini quiz with loops, conditions, and score tracking
- **Week 2** - Mini game with functions, while loops, conditions and stats tracking
- **Week 3** - Mini calculator with functions, while loops, return values, errors handling with try/except
