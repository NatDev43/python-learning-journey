# Python Learning Journey

This repository is my logbook for learning Python.  
Each week I complete a small project to practice new concepts.

## Projects

- **Week 1** – Mini quiz with loops, conditions, and score tracking

## How to run

Navigate to the folder of each week and run the Python script with:

```bash
python quiz.py
